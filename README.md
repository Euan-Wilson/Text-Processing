# Text-Processing
The two assignments in the text processing module for my MSc in Data Analytics.

## Assignment 1: Sentiment Analysis

* Implementing and analysisng the perfomance of different varaitions of a Naive Bayes model for sentiment analysis on a series of datasets.

### Assignment 2: Document Retrieval

* Forming an IR system for document retrieval based on the vector space model.
* The model allows the use of different preprocessing choices such as stoplisting and stemming
* The model allows different term-weighting schemes such as binary, term-frequency, TFIDF
* Performance metrics (F-score, recall and precision) of combinations of preprocessing and term-weighting were calculated and compared using a gold standard.
